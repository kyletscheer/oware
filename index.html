      Kyle Notes: Need to make for continuous play when landing in a full thing.
      Need to create a reset game button. Need to improve design (at least for 2
      end holes). The count does not run counterclockwise (always left to
      right), and capturing each hollow seems to be wrong as well. Fix double
      play for player 1. Create a smart mathematical equation to make a computer
      opponent?
